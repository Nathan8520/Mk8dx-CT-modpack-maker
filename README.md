# Mk8dx-CT-modpack-maker

This is a work in progress way for people to easily compile supported tracks into modpacks without having to manually rename all of the files or have any knowledge of how to mod the game really.

To make a modpack download the latest version of python ( tested on python 3.10 ) and run the main.py file.
Follow the instructions and you will end up with a modpack generated in the folder you specified.

There are currently 49 supported tracks but more will be added as more of them are released but if you think i have missed a good one then send me the link on discord (Nathan_#1987) and i will add it.
For details of exactly which tracks are supported and who created them check https://gamebanana.com/mods/377720
