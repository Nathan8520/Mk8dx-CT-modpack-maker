# Mk8dx-CT-modpack-maker
  
This is a work in progress way for people to easily compile supported tracks into modpacks without having to manually rename all of the files or have any knowledge of how to mod the game really.  
  
To make a modpack:  
- Clone this repo  
- Install the latest version of python ( tested on python 3.10 )  
- Install pyqt6 (pip install pyqt6)  
- Run the main.py file  
  
There are currently 63 supported tracks but more will be added as more of them are released but if you think i have missed a good one then send me the link on discord (Nathan_#1987) and i will add it.  
For details of exactly which tracks are supported and who created them check https://gamebanana.com/mods/377720
