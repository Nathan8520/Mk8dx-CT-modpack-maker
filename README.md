# Mk8dx-CT-modpack-maker

This is a work in progress way for people to easily compile supported tracks into modpacks without having to manually rename all of the files or have any knowledge of how to mod the game.  
I only started playing custom tracks very recently so maybe a tool like this already exists but in case it doesnt here it is. So far i have had no issues playing custom tracks compiled over random tracks but i have not done extensive testing so there could be issues with this idea that i am not aware of yet. 
  
To make a modpack all you need is a recent version of python (tested on python 3.10).  
-Clone this repo  
-Run the main.py file  
-Enter the index of the track that you want to overwrite*  
-Enter the index of the custom track you want to play (or just press enter to remove one)  
-When you have setup all of the tracks you want pres enter  
-Input the folder name that you want  
-Your modpack will be generated  
  
*You can also type random to get a random selection of custom tracks instantly  
Inside the folder that you specified the name of there will be a romfs folder and a credits file which will credit all of the authors of the tracks as none of them were made by me.  
  
I will try and add any new custom tracks that i see but if there are any that i miss or old ones that you think i should add then message me on discord (Nathan_#1987) and i will add them.  
  
This is still in very early stages and i plan to add lots more to this.  
These are some of the major improvements that need to be made:  
-Add support for custom music, combine all of the BGM.bars files  
-Add support for the message.SARC files  
-Add more custom tracks  
-Make the interface more user friendly and add more options  
-Add the rest of the tracks to ported over (32 currently supported)  
  
Since i am quite new to all of this there is some information that i am missing in order to complete all of the things listed above.  
Some of them i couldnt find online and others i just havent looked into yet so if you can provide any of them following then please contact me on discord (Nathan_#1987)  
-The filenames for the rest of the tracks  
-The filenames for the audio files  
-How to combine the BGM.bars files  
-How to combine the message.SARC files  
  
Note: From now until the end of June i will be doing exams so i might not be able to keep things as up to date as i would like or respond to messages as quickly but i will still try to keep improving this as much as i can.
